WhatsOnChain API
----------------

The role of this type of component is to provide a locally usable API that can be used within
a developer's local environment to prototype code that will use WhatsOnChain's API as
can be found here:

  `https://developers.whatsonchain.com/ <https://developers.whatsonchain.com/>`_

It is envisioned that this API will be fleshed out to work as closely as it can with the
live official API, as the need to locally test functionality that relies on more and more of
the WhatsOnChain API is developed against the development environment this component is part
of.
