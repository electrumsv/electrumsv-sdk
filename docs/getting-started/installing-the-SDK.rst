Instructions
============
To install from pypi_ run::

    > pip install --upgrade electrumsv-sdk


.. _pypi: https://pypi.org/project/electrumsv-sdk/

As long as your :code:`<python dir>/Scripts` directory is on system PATH (which it
usually will be by default), you now have global access to a script called
:code:`electrumsv-sdk.exe` from any console window.
